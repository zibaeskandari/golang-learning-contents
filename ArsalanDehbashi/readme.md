# Coding Challenge - Maximize Shelf Stability Score

Since the objective was to maximize the score, defined as the sum of each product's weight multiplied by
the level it's assigned to, I decided to start putting heaviest items on the top shelf because they contribute
significantly more to the score when placed on a higher shelf.

Therefore, I first sorted products in descending order of weight and shelves in descending order of level, defind as
`model.Level.Order` in the app. Then, starting from the heaviest product, I tried to place it on the highest shelf
where it fit without exceeding capacity. If it couldn't fit, I moved it down to the next shelf, repeating this process
until a valid placement was found. If a valid placement couldn't be found for a product, an error was returned stating that
`there isn't enough capacity to place all the products`.

Finally, a list of products was achieved which was used to calculate the final score, which was supposed to be the
maximum score possible without breaking constraints.

# Edit 1
Before, I was assigning heaviest products to the top shelves. Now, because a new constraint has been issued, I've changed
the shelves sorting based on their capacities not their orders. Now, heaviest products are assigned to the shelves with
more capacities.
