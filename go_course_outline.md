## Practices

### Session 1:

- Is there any destructor in Golang
- How can I override value type in this method

```go
func Test(value int) {
    println("test")
    value = 20
}
```
### Session 2
- why interface is a value type
- customize error handling
- in the code we have practice for panic and you should findout how if panics happened after codes how should be run

```go
defer func() {
	if r := recover(); r != nil {
		println("test")
	}
}()

TestPanic()

println("after panic")

func TestPanic() {
	println("before panic")
	panic("test")
}
```
